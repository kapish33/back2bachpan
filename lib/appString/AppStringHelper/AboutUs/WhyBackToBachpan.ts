    over 60 were recorded in India, comprising 8.6% of the total
    population. This figure is expected to rise significantly to 319
    million by 2050. India currently faces challenges in providing
    adequate infrastructure and expertise to support the health and
    well-being of the elderly. Consequently, many elderly individuals
    feel neglected, demotivated, and lack the wherewithal or resources
    to address their own issues.`,
